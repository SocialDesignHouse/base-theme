	RULES

	If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in _shame.scss.

	Document all hacks fully:
		1) What part of the codebase does it relate to?
		2) Why was this needed?
		3) How does this fix it?
		4) How might you fix it properly, given more time?

	Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.

	Try and clean _shame.scss up when you have some down time.

	Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

	The name is purely comical, there is no real shame in a hack. We all write a hack at some point pre- or post-production.

	This way the hacks are easy to find, though.
